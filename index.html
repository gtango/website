                To those who know me I go by Gav, but to the government I go by Gavril Tango.
                I currently reside in the state of Maryland, though it's not where I am from.
                As a military child, I moved around alot as well as all over the world and I never really got to call a place home.
                Home is where the family is i.e. Maryland.

                <br>
                I recently graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
                My decision to pursue computer science stemmed from multiple factors, the main one being me wanting to follow my
                fathers footsteps in the STEM field. 

                <br><br>
                Also, Big Bang Theory was one of my favorite shows as a kid and I lowkey wanted to be like the main characters. 
                Knowing I was not smart enough to be a physicist/scientist like Sheldon or Leonard, I chose engineering like Howard.

                <br><br>
                During my time at UCSC I learned quite a lot, whether it be algorithms and data structures, programming languages or
                the computer systems that construct our society today. For programming languages, I would say that I am proficient in 
                Java, C and Python while having prior experience with C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Haskell, Smalltalk, Ocaml. Frameworks
                I have worked with include Vue.js and React. I have worked in a group in which we utilized all of these skills as well
                as the scrum framework.
                <br><br>
                As of now, I am still practicing and sharpening these skills but I am ready to practice these skills in a professional 
                setting. Below is a link to my resume, should any person looking at my site be looking to hire. <em>please, dear god do.</em>
